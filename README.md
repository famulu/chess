# Chess
Chess is a Ruby chess application that implements chess move validation, chess piece movement/capturing, moves reversal and re-execution (undo and redo) and check/checkmate detection. It also supplies a simple chessboard GUI allowing you to play chess as is.

## Inspiration
Despite being horrible at the game, I have always been fascinated by the game of chess. For example, did you know that even if we were to make a universe-sized perfectly efficient computer, it would still take more than 2 billion years for it to analyze every single game of chess!!!
